        The manifesto was written by Richard Phoenix, who has spent over ten
        years dedicated to using his ability, privilege and experience to open
        up the D.I.Y. ethos to musicians with learning disabilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        He has supported the creation of a music scene in Brighton around the
        long running Rock House night; organised three UK tours for bands with
        members with learning disabilities; supported DIY Space For London to be
        the first volunteer run venue in the UK to achieve Bronze accreditation
        for access; and worked as a music facilitator supporting people with
        learning disabilities to form bands, create music, record and perform,
        as well as organising countless other gigs, releases, events and
        projects. He has found that these scenes are the most wildly creative,
        egoless, positive, full of the most amazing music, fun and the best he’s
        ever been a part of.

        This is the second version of the manifesto, it uses the words ‘Disabled
        people’ rather than ‘People with Disabilities’. This is so the language
        in the text better reflects the social model of disability.

        Why I wrote the Manifesto
        <br />
        <br />
        On the 4th December 2006 I saw the bands Beat Express and Heavy Load
        play in Brighton. It was the first time I had seen musicians with
        learning disabilities on stage performing and it was one of the best
        gigs I’ve ever been to. I wondered why I hadn’t heard of or seen these
        musicians play before. I thought that if I had enjoyed it so much, then
        other people would too. It also made me realise the opportunities I had
        as a musician weren’t available to everyone. So, since then I’ve done
        all I can to support all kinds of people to make all kinds of music,
        share this music and get others to watch and listen. I think everyone
        should have the chance to experience a little of what I’ve been lucky
        enough to experience since 2006. I will forever be grateful for
        everything I have learnt from being involved with all of this. I wrote
        the manifesto to try and encourage others to get involved and help make
        more and more things happen.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2006 I only knew two bands existed, now I can write a list of
        fifty-three amazing bands and musicians I’ve been lucky enough to see
        and hear over the years. Some existed for just one night and some have
        been playing for years, all of them helped change mine and other
        people’s worlds, even in some small way. I hope this list will only get
        longer and longer!
