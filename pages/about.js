            <h3 css={styles.h3}>D.I.Y.</h3>
            <p>
              Stands for <span css={styles.italic}>“Do It Yourself”</span>. In
              music it promotes the idea that anyone is capable of becoming a
              musician and sharing their music. It empowers individuals and
              communities, encouraging alternative approaches when faced with
              obstacles to achieving their objectives.

          <div>
            <h3 css={styles.h3}>disability</h3>
            <p>
              I use the social model of disability. The idea that it is the
              environment, society and culture that surrounds someone that
              creates barriers and obstacles which disable and exclude them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 css={styles.h3}>privilege</h3>
            <p>
              The idea that advantages are available only to certain people in
              society.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 css={styles.h3}>manifesto</h3>
            <p>
              A text that promotes a new idea with ways for carrying out changes
              the author believes should be made.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            This is the second version of the manifesto, it uses the words{' '}
            <span css={styles.italic}>‘Disabled people’</span> rather than{' '}
            <span css={styles.italic}>‘People with Disabilities’</span>. This is
            so the language in the text better reflects the social model of
            disability.
          </p>
          <p>
